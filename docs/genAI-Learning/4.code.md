If the include_credentials parameter is True (the default value), the credentials required to connect to the connection are returned - for example, in the form of an API key for a Foundry Tools resource.


    The following Python code sample uses the get_openai_client() method to get an OpenAI client with which to chat with a model that has been deployed in the project's Microsoft Foundry resource.
